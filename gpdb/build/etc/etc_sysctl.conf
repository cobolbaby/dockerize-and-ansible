# Failed system call was shmget(key=40002001, size=615342704, 03600).
# This error usually means that PostgreSQL's request for a shared memory segment exceeded your kernel's SHMMAX parameter.
# You can either reduce the request size or reconfigure the kernel with larger SHMMAX. 
# To reduce the request size (currently 615342704 bytes), reduce PostgreSQL's shared_buffers parameter (currently 4000) and/or its max_connections parameter (currently 5003).
# If the request size is already small, it's possible that it is less than your kernel's SHMMIN parameter.
